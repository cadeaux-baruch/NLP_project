# NLP_project
Kaggle's toxic comment dataset
---
I encountered this project after being told that I needed to aim higher. I believe that by looking at neural nets, I could find a way to solve a multi-label, somewhat large dataset in NLP. I have always thought that teaching machines to understand language would take a huge leap forward in technology. I am glad that I came across this project and have learned alot in the journey to categorize it's contents. The wordclouds in the sklearn files are not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. These data points exist in order to teach the computer to detect them. I only hope that when I add the analysis and video, the necessity of the wordclouds comes to light.
